                    With the nation of Panem in a full-scale war, Katniss
                    confronts President Snow in the final showdown. Teamed with
                    a group of her closest friends – including Gale, Finnick,
                    and Peeta – Katniss goes off on a mission with the unit from
                    District 13 as they risk their lives to liberate the
                    citizens of Panem, and stage an assassination attempt on
                    President Snow who has become increasingly obsessed with
                    destroying her. The mortal traps, enemies, and moral choices
                    that await Katniss will challenge her more than any arena
                    she faced in the Hunger Games.

                    Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) recovers after nearly
                    being murdered by Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), who had
                    been "hijacked" by the Capitol. She asks President Alma Coin
                    (Julianne Moore) to send her to District Two, the last
                    district outside rebel control. During her recovery, Katniss
                    visits Peeta; he is recovering some of his memories but
                    remains unstable and resentful towards Katniss, which causes
                    her to become depressed. She approaches Coin and demands to
                    kill Snow as her "final mission", but Coin declines in favor
                    of preserving Katniss as the symbol of their revolution.
                    Katniss and her camera crew, along with Finnick and Gale,
                    are assigned to Squad 451, the "Star Squad", led by Boggs
                    (Mahershala Ali). However, they discover that their mission
                    is to trail behind the invasion and be the onscreen face of
                    the rebellion. They use a holographic map called a Holo to
                    evade "pods" (booby traps) created by Gamemakers which line
                    the streets of the Capitol; Finnick cynically compares the
                    pods to an arena by remarking "Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome
                    to the 76th Hunger Games.". Peeta is unexpectedly assigned
                    to the team by Coin despite still being vulnerable to the
                    Capitol's conditioning. Boggs warns Katniss to be careful
                    around him, because Coin sees Katniss as a potential threat
                    to her authority, and may have placed Peeta on the team to
                    indirectly eliminate her. Katniss initially acts hostile
                    towards Peeta, but eventually they begin to open up to one
                    another, as she realizes he has trouble telling real
                    memories from hijacked ones.

                <p class="plot_text">
                    As they are still far from Snow's mansion, the team decides
                    to venture into the Capitol's sewers in order to avoid the
                    pods, using Pollux (Elden Henson) as a guide, since he used
                    to work in the underground. Peeta, remorseful over
                    Mitchell's death, believes he should die rather than
                    endanger the rest of the squad again, but admits to Katniss
                    that his memories are becoming clearer. Snow, discovering
                    Katniss is still alive, unleashes a pack of monstrous
                    reptilian muttations to hunt her down. They are attacked by
                    Peacekeepers after reaching the underground railways, during
                    which another pod kills Messalla (Evan Ross). The few
                    survivors eventually reach the surface and Cressida (Natalie
                    Dormer) leads them to a safehouse, where a former Hunger
                    Games stylist, Tigris (Eugenie Bondurant), hides them in her
                    basement. Snow announces that the rebels have penetrated
                    deep into the Capitol and asks refugees to come to his
                    mansion, offering them with food and shelter. With the pods
                    deactivated to allow passage, Katniss and Gale disguise
                    themselves and mingle with the refugees to gain access to
                    Snow. Upon the explosion, a team of rebel medics attempt to
                    help the injured, among whom is Katniss' sister, Prim
                    (Willow Shields). Shocked to see her sister on the
                    battlefield, Katniss heads towards her, but just as Prim
                    sees her a second round of bombs go off, killing Prim and
                    badly injuring Katniss.

                    Upon recovering, Katniss learns from Haymitch that the
                    Capitol has been conquered by the rebels, and that Snow has
                    been captured. Katniss confronts the imprisoned Snow, who
                    claims that Coin masterminded the child-bombings in order to
                    turn his remaining supporters against him; Coin has thus
                    played both Snow and Katniss "for fools" because they were
                    both too focused on destroying each other to see her
                    endgame. When Katniss accuses him of lying, he calmly
                    reminds her of their promise to always be truthful to each
                    other. Coin proposes having one final edition of the Hunger
                    Games with the children of the Capitol as retribution for
                    the previous games, as an alternative to exterminating most
                    of the Capitol's population as war criminals. Beetee, Annie
                    and Peeta vote no, while Johanna and Enobaria vote yes.
                    Realizing that Snow was right about Coin's ambitions and
                    ruthlessness, Katniss votes in favor of the motion "for
                    Prim," which gains Coin's trust; Haymitch follows her lead.

                    At the execution, which is being held before the whole of
                    Panem, Katniss faces Snow once again. As she readies her
                    bow, the two make eye contact, and Snow gives her one last
                    smile. Katniss silently agrees, and instead shoots the arrow
                    into Coin's heart, killing her. After an initial period of
                    depression, Katniss is eventually able to release her grief
                    over Prim's death. Commander Paylor is elected the new
                    President of Panem, and Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch bond
                    over their shared trauma. Years later, Katniss and Peeta are
                    shown to have two children. As Katniss' infant child wakes
                    up from a nightmare she reminisces about her own recurring
                    nightmares she still suffers from and explains she plays "a
                    game" where she lists all the good things she has seen
                    someone do. She notes that while the game has grown tedious
                    over the years, "there are much worse games to play", as she
                    smiles into the camera before the screen cuts to black.
