                    <b>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1</b> is an American
                    2014 Sci-Fi/Dystopian feature film directed by Francis
                    Lawrence and adaptation of the first half of Mockingjay by
                    Suzanne Collins. It is the sequel to The Hunger Games:
                    Catching Fire and third film in The Hunger Games film

                <p class="info__text">
                    The story continues to follow Katniss Everdeen; having twice
                    survived the Hunger Games, Katniss finds herself in District
                    13. Under the leadership of President Coin and the advice of
                    her trusted friends, Katniss reluctantly becomes the symbol
                    of a mass rebellion, a mockingjay, against the Capitol and
                    fights to save Peeta and a nation moved by her courage.

                <p class="info__text">
                    The film gained mixed reviews from critics (more positive
                    than negative) and was Nominated for Best Original Song in
                    the 72nd Golden Globe Awards.

                    After being rescued from the destroyed arena in the 75th
                    Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen, along with fellow Victors
                    Beetee and Finnick Odair, are taken to District 13, an
                    underground rebel facility hidden beneath the ruins of the
                    old District 13, where she is reunited with her mother and
                    sister Prim. While recuperating, she is introduced to
                    President Alma Coin, the rebel leader, and is told that her
                    actions in the arena sparked riots and strikes against the
                    Capitol. Coin asks her if she will become the
                    "Mockingjay"—the symbol of the rebellion—as part of their
                    "hearts and minds" strategy. Katniss flatly declines,
                    angrily reminding her that they left Peeta Mellark, her
                    portrayed lover and fellow District 12 tribute, behind in
                    the arena. At the suggestion of Plutarch Heavensbee, the
                    former Gamemaker, she is taken to see the ruins of District
                    12, which was completely leveled by a Capitol bombing
                    campaign (with the exception of the houses in the Victor's
                    Village). After seeing that Peeta is being used by Capitol
                    state television to try and quell the rebellion, Katniss
                    reluctantly changes her mind and agrees to become Coin's
                    Mockingjay, on the condition that Peeta and the other
                    victors will be rescued at the earliest opportunity and
                    pardoned.
                </p>
                <p class="plot_text">
                    After Haymitch notes that Katniss thrives on spontaneity,
                    she is introduced to her film team (led by Capitol escapee
                    Cressida), is dressed up in a specially-designed outfit, and
                    given Effie Trinket as a stylist and close friend Gale as a
                    bodyguard. They go out to District 8 to visit a hospital,
                    but as the visit concludes, a Capitol bombing squadron
                    arrives and bombs the hospital, killing everyone inside. In
                    her rage, Katniss gives a rousing speech to the camera,
                    which is broadcast when Beetee hijacks the Capitol's news
                    feed. The team then go back to District 12, where Gale tells
                    the story of its destruction, and Katniss is filmed singing
                    "The Hanging Tree". After both are broadcast, strikers in
                    District 7 kill an entire team of Peacekeepers with hidden
                    land mines, and a rebel demolition team from District 5
                    destroys the dam providing the Capitol with electricity,
                    forcing them to use power generators and weakening their
                    ability to broadcast their propaganda.

                <p class="plot_text">
                    That night, Katniss is watching Peeta being interviewed by
                    Caesar Flickerman, the Games' former presenter, when, in an
                    apparent defiance of his captors, he suddenly shouts a
                    warning to the camera that the Capitol is about to attack
                    District 13. Coin orders a mass evacuation into the
                    underground shelters. While Prim is nearly locked out when
                    she goes back to get her cat, everyone manages to get inside
                    safely, and the facility survives the attack unharmed. Upon
                    emerging, Katniss discovers that the area is littered with
                    white roses, and realizes that President Snow has sent them
                    to taunt her, and presumes that he is about to kill Peeta.
                    As Peeta's warning gave the District an additional eight
                    minutes evacuation time, Coin dispatches an elite special
                    forces team, which includes Gale, to rescue him, along with
                    Johanna Mason, and Annie Cresta, the remaining Victors, from
                    their prison in the Capitol's Tribute center. The rescue is
                    successful. However, when Katniss goes to greet Peeta, he
                    unexpectedly attacks and strangles her into unconsciousness,
                    before being knocked unconscious himself by Boggs.
                </p>
                <p class="plot_text">
                    Katniss wakes up in the medical facility, and is informed
                    that Peeta has been "hijacked"— a form of physical/mental
                    torture in which he is brainwashed into wanting to kill
                    Katniss through aversion therapy and tracker jacker
                    venom—explaining why the Capitol allowed Gale's team to
                    escape. A process to undo the therapy begins, with Peeta
                    kept in isolation. Meanwhile, Coin announces the successful
                    rescue of the Victors, and that the fight may now be taken
                    to the Capitol.[2] During Coin's speech, Katniss looks for
                    Peeta and looks in horror as she sees the hijacked Peeta in
                    solitary confinement, restrained.
