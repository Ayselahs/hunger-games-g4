                    The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a 2013 American dystopian
                    science fiction action film directed by Francis Lawrence
                    based on the 2009 novel Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins.
                    The sequel to The Hunger Games (2012), it is the second
                    installment in The Hunger Games film series.
                </p>
                <p class="info__text">
                    As the second installment in the series, Catching Fire
                    begins a few months after Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer
                    Lawrence) and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark
                    (Hutcherson) have returned home safely after winning the
                    74th Annual Hunger Games. Throughout the story, Katniss
                    senses that a rebellion against the oppressive Capitol is
                    simmering among the districts. As the third "Quarter Quell"
                    is approaching Katinss and Peeta are preparing to be in the
                    75th Hunger Games with previous victors.

                <p class="info__text">
                    Catching Fire received positive reviews and is considered by
                    critics to be an improvement over the first in the series
                    with the sentiment being that it's a more-confident,
                    more-polished movie. The Song Atlas was nominated for a
                    Grammy and a Golden Globe.

                    Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have settled into a life
                    of material comfort and emotional unease back in District 12
                    following their joint victory in the 74th Hunger Games.
                    President Snow visits Katniss and explains that her actions
                    in the Games — specifically, her would-be suicide pact with
                    Peeta — have inspired uprisings across Panem. He orders her
                    to use the upcoming Victory Tour to convince him that her
                    actions were out of love and not defiance against the
                    Capitol, warning her that her friends, family, and everyone
                    else in District 12 will otherwise face execution. Katniss'
                    mentor, Haymitch, later warns her that Victors of the games
                    must serve as mentors to future tributes and that their show
                    of love will be forced to continue for the rest of their
                    lives.Unrest and protests are on display in many Districts
                    over the course of the Victory Tour, as is brutality by
                    local Peacekeepers. Peeta and Katniss subsequently announce
                    their engagement in an attempt to quell the Districts. At an
                    upper-class party concluding the tour, Snow publicly toasts
                    them but subtly signals to Katniss that he remains
                    unconvinced. During the festivities, Katniss meets enigmatic
                    new head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. Peacekeepers led by
                    the brutal Commander Romulus Thread begin to mercilessly
                    raid homes and other places throughout District 12, placing
                    the citizens under curfew. Katniss's friend Gale is publicly
                    whipped after tackling Thread to stop him from killing
                    civilians; he is saved by Katniss and the other victors.
                    Heavensbee tells Snow that the rebellion cannot survive
                    Katniss new celebrity status as a victor.

                <p class="plot__text">
                    The upcoming 75th Hunger Games - the third "Quarter Quell" —
                    is announced, with tributes set to be selected from previous
                    victors. Katniss devotes herself to ensuring Peeta survives.
                    On Reaping Day, Haymitch's name is drawn, but Peeta
                    immediately volunteers to take his place. The adult
                    tributes, accustomed to a safe and comfortable life as
                    victors, are openly angry about being forced to return to
                    the Games. For her pre-Games interview, Katniss wears a
                    wedding dress, as ordered by Snow, but her stylist Cinna
                    sets it to transform into a symbol of a mockingjay. As an
                    effort to stop the games, Peeta lies during his interview,
                    saying that he and Katniss have married in secret and are
                    expecting a child, which leads to fruitless protests from
                    citizens for the Games to be stopped. Just before Katniss
                    enters the arena, Cinna is beaten to death by Peacekeepers
                    in front of her as punishment for tampering with her
                    dress.In the Games, Katniss and Peeta ally themselves with
                    the District 4 tributes, playboy Finnick Odair and his
                    elderly mentor Mags. When the arena's forcefield shocks
                    Peeta, stopping his heart, Finnick resuscitates him. The
                    group is later forced to flee from a poisonous fog; when
                    Peeta cannot go on, Mags sacrifices herself so that Finnick
                    can help him. The group discovers that water removes the
                    gas-induced blisters. When mandrills attack, Peeta is saved
                    by the unexpected sacrifice of a drug-addicted tribute from
                    District 6. The group escapes to the beach, where they meet
                    up with Beetee and Wiress, a pair of scientist tributes from
                    District 3, and acerbic District 7 tribute Johanna Mason.
                    Wiress, who has suffered a nervous breakdown, repeats the
                    phrase "tick-tock", leading Katniss to realize that the
                    arena is designed like a clock, with regular hazards each
                    hour contained within their respective zones. Wiress's
                    throat is slit by Gloss, one of the Careers from District 1.
                    Gloss is then fatally shot by Katniss while Johanna kills
                    his sister, Cashmere. Finnick is injured by another Career.
                    Heavensbee has the Gamemakers spin the clock to disorient
                    the tributes.

                <p class="plot__text">
                    Beetee suggests luring the rest of the Careers to the wet
                    beach and electrocuting them, taking advantage of the
                    lightning that strikes every 12 hours. The group separates
                    to prepare the trap, laying down wire. When District 2
                    tributes Brutus and Enobaria emerge, Johanna stuns Katniss,
                    cuts the tracker out of her arm and flees. Katniss finds an
                    unconscious Beetee. Unable to find Peeta, and hearing a
                    cannon, Katniss almost kills Finnick, thinking he betrayed
                    them, but he reminds her to "remember who the real enemy
                    is". Katniss attaches wire to an arrow and shoots it into
                    the arena roof just as lightning strikes. The lightning is
                    conducted along the wire, causing the arena shields to fail
                    and the roof to fall, and Katniss is knocked unconscious.
                    Katniss awakens in an aircraft with Haymitch, Finnick, a
                    still-unconscious Beetee, and Heavensbee, who is revealed to
                    be a rebel against Snow. Haymitch tells her they are bound
                    for District 13, headquarters of the new rebellion. He
                    reveals that half the tributes were in on a plan to rescue
                    Katniss, a symbol of the growing rebellion, but that Peeta
                    and Johanna have been captured by the Capitol. They thought
                    it would have been better for her not to know due to Snow
                    watching her. An enraged Katniss is sedated after attempting
                    to attack Haymitch for violating his promise to save Peeta.
                    She awakens to find Gale by her side, who reassures her that
                    her family is safe but that District 12 has been destroyed
                    by the Capitol.
