<h1> Challenges We Had </h1>
<h2>Our groups’ main challenges were with merging branches and changes.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Other than Ayselah, the rest of the group had not had experience with creating branches of a repository. It took the rest of the group a little bit to figure out how to create a branch and work off it on the local repository.</li>
<li>Patrick stated collaborating through GitHub and using the software was more difficult than he originally thought it would be. He would have liked a less intense project to first learn how to collaborate using GitHub. Sophie and Jayce agreed with Patrick - as first time coders, this project was very intense.</li>
<li>Jacey had trouble committing her branch because there was a fatal error due to the DS.store file. Patrick and Jayce were able to email their code form their local files to Ayselah who was able to update the files in the main branch to reflect the changes that were not merging when pushed/pulled. </li> 
<li>Patrick created the original CSS file using a grid layout for the homepage (index.html), however the grid didn’t work with the other site pages. We had to change the display to a use a combination of flex and grid to work with the various containers.</li> 
<li>The group agreed from the beginning to have a unified CSS page so that the appearance was consistent across the site. Patrick and Sophie collaborated on the BEM naming conventions so that Jacey and Ayselah had matching identifiers.</li>
<li>Ayselah is a coding genius and was able to rectify many of the issues we had with merging branches.</li>
